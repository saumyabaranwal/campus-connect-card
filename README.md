# 💳 Campus Connect Card (C³)

**Campus Connect Card (C³)** is a smart payment solution made just for college campuses.  
It lets students make quick, cashless payments at cafes, print shops, tuck shops, and other campus spots — all using one connected card and an easy-to-use web dashboard.

## 🚀 What It Does

- Shows **balance**, **daily spending**, and **remaining limit**  
- Tracks **recent transactions** and **spending by category**  
- Lets users **top up** instantly  
- Works **only within the campus**, just like a metro card  
- Includes an **offline mode** for when Wi-Fi or servers fluctuate

## 🧠 The Idea

We wanted to simplify student payments inside college.  
C³ connects an **offline-access smart card** with a **web app** that manages all activity securely.  
Even during internet issues, the card continues to work, ensuring smooth campus transactions.
